    /// Octree:	An octree is a tree data structure which divides 3D space into smaller partitions (nodes)
    /// and places objects into the appropriate nodes. This allows fast access to objects
    /// in an area of interest without having to check every object.
    /// 
    /// Dynamic: The octree grows or shrinks as required when objects as added or removed.
    /// It also splits and merges nodes as appropriate. There is no maximum depth.
    /// Nodes have a constant - <see cref="BoundsOctree{T}.Node.NumObjectsAllowed"/> - which sets the amount of items allowed in a node before it splits.
    /// 
    /// Loose: The octree's nodes can be larger than 1/2 their parent's length and width, so they overlap to some extent.
    /// This can alleviate the problem of even tiny objects ending up in large nodes if they're near boundaries.
    /// A looseness value of 1.0 will make it a "normal" octree.
    /// 
    /// Note: For loops are often used here since in some cases (e.g. the IsColliding method)
    /// they actually give much better performance than using Foreach, even in the compiled build.
    /// Using a LINQ expression is worse again than Foreach.
    /// 
    /// See also: <see cref="PointOctree{T}"/>, where objects are stored as single points and some code can be simplified
    /// </remarks>
